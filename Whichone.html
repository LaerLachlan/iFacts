<h2> Which One Should You Buy? </h2> <p> It depends which features of the phones you like. If you don't want to loose the button home button than I would choose the iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus. If you want a small phone, schoose the iPhone 8. If you want a big phone, choose the iPhone 8 PLus. If you like the idea of no home button and have the money, i'd get the iPhone X. Even if you have US$99 that doesn't include the other stuff you want for your iPhone. like AppleCare+ or an AirPower or a case or headphones. So the iPhone 8 or 8 Plus is a better choice unless you have the money for the iPhone X and don't mind losing a home button and Touch ID. <br>
