<h2>iPhone X</h2> <p> There is a lot of new stuff in the iPhone X. There is no home button. Yes that's right, no home button! Since there is no home button they have replaced Touch ID with something new, Face ID. Face ID scans your face instead of your finger in order to get into your phone. You must be wondering why they called it the iPhone X? It's because it was Apple's tenth anniversery. So instead of calling iPhone 9, they called it iPhone 10 or the roman numeral version of it, X. <br>
